A written report and video on a fictitious mobile phone app, BeFeel, that uses continous tracking to monitor student mental wellbeing. This was produced as part of an assignment and allowed us to consider the social impact such an application would have. In this report, we explain what our application is and discuss the ethical issues associated with it. This work was carried out by myself and five other students and received a first class grade.
